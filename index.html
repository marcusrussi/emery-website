                        We help academics produce high quality research more quickly and efficiently with cutting edge data systems.
                        The scale and sophistication of quantitative research programs continues to grow, and with it a need to operate 
                        on top of reliable, stable, and fast data infrastructure. Our team has over 10 years of experience in both industry 
                        and academia, from Meta/Facebook to epidemiology and social sciences at Yale and NYU. We bring an intimate familiarity
                        not just with production quality "big" data systems but also with the workflows and unique needs of academic researchers.
